  "intro": {
    "what_is_tla": {
      "title": "What is TLA?",
      "simple": "TLA is a system that rewards people for providing trading liquidity on Terra.",
      "detailed": "The Terra Liquidity Alliance (TLA) is a community-driven initiative that distributes LUNA rewards to liquidity providers. Think of it like a rewards program - when you deposit tokens into trading pools, you earn weekly LUNA based on how much the community votes to support that pool. The more votes a pool gets, the more rewards flow to its depositors.",
      "analogy": "Imagine a shopping mall where store owners (liquidity providers) set up shops (pools). The mall management (TLA) distributes bonus money to stores based on customer votes. Popular, useful stores get more bonuses, which attracts more store owners, which makes the mall better for everyone.",
      "why_exists": "Terra needs deep liquidity for traders to swap tokens efficiently. Without liquidity, trades have high slippage (bad prices). TLA incentivizes people to provide this liquidity by sharing protocol rewards with them."
    },
    "what_is_liquidity": {
      "title": "What is Liquidity?",
      "simple": "Money sitting in a pool that lets others trade.",
      "detailed": "When you want to swap Token A for Token B, someone needs to have Token B available to give you. Liquidity providers deposit pairs of tokens (like LUNA + USDC) into pools. When traders swap, they trade against this pool. In return, LPs earn trading fees plus TLA rewards.",
      "analogy": "Think of a currency exchange booth at an airport. The booth needs to have dollars, euros, yen, etc. on hand to exchange for travelers. The money sitting in the booth is 'liquidity'. The booth earns a small fee on each exchange. You can be like that booth by depositing into pools.",
      "risk_note": "Providing liquidity isn't risk-free. If token prices change significantly, you may experience 'impermanent loss' - getting back a different ratio of tokens than you deposited. Research this before depositing."
    },
    "what_is_epoch": {
      "title": "What is an Epoch?",
      "simple": "A one-week voting and reward cycle.",
      "detailed": "TLA operates in weekly cycles called epochs. Each epoch: (1) People vote on which pools should receive rewards, (2) At epoch end, votes are tallied, (3) Rewards are distributed based on vote share. The next epoch then begins immediately.",
      "timing": "Epochs run Monday to Monday (UTC). Rewards are calculated and distributed shortly after each epoch ends.",
      "analogy": "Think of it like a weekly allowance that gets divided up. Every week, the family votes on how to split the allowance between different savings goals. At week's end, money goes into each goal based on the votes."
    }
  },

  "glossary": {
    "vp": {
      "term": "Voting Power (VP)",
      "simple": "How much voting weight someone has.",
      "detailed": "Voting Power is the weight behind votes. You get VP by locking ampLUNA or arbLUNA tokens in Votion or similar platforms. More tokens locked = more VP. Longer lock duration = bonus VP multiplier. VP determines your influence over which pools receive rewards.",
      "analogy": "Like shares in a company giving you votes at shareholder meetings. More shares = more say in decisions.",
      "how_to_get": "Lock ampLUNA or arbLUNA on platforms like Votion. Longer lock periods give you more VP per token."
    },
    "apr": {
      "term": "APR (Annual Percentage Rate)",
      "simple": "How much you'd earn in a year, shown as a percentage.",
      "detailed": "If a pool shows 50% APR, and you deposit $1,000, you'd earn roughly $500 over a full year (if rates stayed constant). APR includes TLA rewards but may not include trading fees. 'Non-Amp' APR is the base rate; 'Amplified' APR includes bonuses from amplified deposits.",
      "important": "APR is not guaranteed! It changes based on: total deposits in the pool, vote allocation, token prices, and trading activity. Today's 50% APR might be 30% tomorrow.",
      "analogy": "Like the interest rate on a savings account, but much more variable. Bank savings might offer 4% APR. DeFi pools can offer 20-100%+ but with more risk and variability."
    },
    "depth": {
      "term": "Pool Depth / Liquidity",
      "simple": "Total money deposited in a pool.",
      "detailed": "Depth is the total value (in USD) of all tokens deposited in a pool. A pool with $500,000 depth has half a million dollars worth of tokens available for trading. Deeper pools can handle larger trades with less price impact.",
      "why_matters": "Shallow pools (low depth) cause high slippage - traders get bad prices on large orders. Deep pools attract more trading volume because traders get better prices.",
      "analogy": "Like how much inventory a store has. A store with lots of inventory can serve many customers without running out. A store with little inventory might not have what you need."
    },
    "volume": {
      "term": "Trading Volume",
      "simple": "How much trading activity a pool sees.",
      "detailed": "Volume measures the total USD value of swaps through a pool over a time period (usually 24 hours or 7 days). High volume means lots of people are trading that pair. Volume generates fees for liquidity providers.",
      "analogy": "Like daily sales at a store. A busy store with high sales volume is healthier than a quiet one."
    },
    "bribes": {
      "term": "Bribes / Incentives",
      "simple": "Extra rewards offered to attract votes to a pool.",
      "detailed": "Projects or users can offer additional rewards ('bribes') to voters who direct VP toward specific pools. If you vote for a pool with bribes, you earn your share of TLA rewards PLUS the bribe rewards. This helps newer or smaller pools compete for votes.",
      "analogy": "Like a store offering extra coupons to customers who shop there. The base rewards are your 'salary', bribes are 'bonuses' for voting a certain way.",
      "where_to_find": "Phoenix Directive and other platforms distribute bribes. Our dashboard shows 'PD Bribes' (Phoenix Directive) and 'Other Bribes' separately."
    },
    "lsd": {
      "term": "LSD (Liquid Staking Derivative)",
      "simple": "A token that represents staked LUNA but can still be traded.",
      "detailed": "Normally when you stake LUNA, it's locked and earns staking rewards. LSDs like ampLUNA let you stake AND keep a tradeable token. You deposit LUNA, receive ampLUNA, and can use ampLUNA in DeFi while still earning staking rewards. The ampLUNA value grows over time relative to LUNA.",
      "examples": "ampLUNA (Eris Protocol), bLUNA/boneLUNA (Backbone Labs), stLUNA (Stride)",
      "why_popular": "Best of both worlds - earn staking yield AND use your tokens in DeFi. That's why LSD pools are heavily supported in TLA."
    },
    "slippage": {
      "term": "Slippage",
      "simple": "Getting a worse price than expected on a trade.",
      "detailed": "When you swap tokens, the actual price you get might differ from the quoted price - this difference is slippage. Large trades in shallow pools cause more slippage. A 1% slippage on a $10,000 trade costs you $100.",
      "analogy": "Like buying concert tickets - the price shown might be $50, but after fees and markup, you pay $55. That extra $5 is like slippage."
    },
    "impermanent_loss": {
      "term": "Impermanent Loss (IL)",
      "simple": "Potential loss from price changes when providing liquidity.",
      "detailed": "When you deposit tokens in a pool, the pool automatically rebalances as prices change. If one token's price moves significantly, you might end up with less total value than if you'd just held the tokens. It's called 'impermanent' because if prices return to original levels, the loss disappears.",
      "important": "IL is a real risk in DeFi. Pools with correlated assets (like LUNA/ampLUNA) have minimal IL. Pools with uncorrelated assets (like LUNA/BTC) can have significant IL during volatility.",
      "analogy": "Imagine trading baseball cards with a friend, agreeing to always keep equal value on each side. If one player suddenly becomes famous, you'd have traded away valuable cards to maintain the balance."
    }
  },

  "metrics": {
    "efficiency": {
      "label": "Efficiency",
      "simple": "How hard the pool's money is working.",
      "detailed": "Efficiency = Volume ÷ Liquidity. A pool with $100K liquidity doing $50K daily volume is more efficient (50%) than a pool with $1M liquidity doing $50K volume (5%). Higher efficiency means the deposited capital is being used more actively.",
      "formula": "Efficiency = Average Volume / Average Liquidity",
      "interpretation": {
        "high": { "label": "High (>30%)", "meaning": "Pool is actively traded, generating good fees relative to capital" },
        "medium": { "label": "Medium (10-30%)", "meaning": "Moderate trading activity" },
        "low": { "label": "Low (<10%)", "meaning": "Capital may be underutilized, or pool serves as stable store-of-value" }
      },
      "why_matters": "Efficient pools generate more trading fees per dollar deposited. But efficiency isn't everything - stable pairs naturally have lower efficiency but serve important functions.",
      "nuance": "A low-efficiency pool isn't necessarily bad. USDC-USDT might have low efficiency but is crucial infrastructure for stable swaps."
    },
    "vote_pct": {
      "label": "Vote Share (%)",
      "simple": "What percentage of all votes this pool received.",
      "detailed": "If a pool has 10% vote share, it receives 10% of that epoch's total LUNA rewards (for its category). Higher vote share = more rewards flowing to that pool's LPs. Vote share constantly shifts as voters reallocate.",
      "why_matters": "Vote share directly determines rewards. A pool going from 5% to 10% vote share doubles its reward distribution.",
      "your_action": "If you hold VP, you decide vote share by where you allocate votes. Choose pools you believe deserve support."
    },
    "adao_allocation": {
      "label": "aDAO Allocation",
      "simple": "How much Alliance DAO has invested in this pool.",
      "detailed": "Alliance DAO (aDAO) votes with its community treasury to support ecosystem pools. When aDAO allocates to a pool, it signals community confidence and adds significant VP. The 'aDAO %' shows what portion of the pool's votes come from aDAO.",
      "why_tracked": "Large aDAO allocation means strong community backing. Zero allocation might indicate a pool the community hasn't prioritized yet - could be an opportunity or a warning sign depending on context."
    },
    "four_epoch_avg": {
      "label": "4-Epoch Average",
      "simple": "Average over the last 4 weeks.",
      "detailed": "Rather than showing just today's snapshot, we average liquidity and volume over 4 epochs (4 weeks). This smooths out temporary spikes or dips and shows the pool's typical behavior.",
      "why_four": "One week can be anomalous. Four weeks reveals patterns. Is this pool consistently active or was last week a fluke?"
    }
  },

  "scores": {
    "overview": {
      "title": "Understanding Scores",
      "simple": "We rate pools from 0-100 to help you compare them.",
      "detailed": "Raw numbers like '$50,000 liquidity' are hard to compare across different pools. Our scoring system converts everything to 0-100 scales, weights different factors, and produces composite scores. Higher = generally better, but always consider context.",
      "disclaimer": "Scores are tools, not financial advice. A high-scoring pool might still not suit your goals. A low-scoring pool might be exactly what you need. Use scores as one input among many."

  "faq": {
    "getting_started": {
      "question": "I'm new to Terra. Where do I start?",
      "answer": "Welcome! Here's a suggested path: (1) Get a Cosmos wallet like Keplr or Leap, (2) Acquire some LUNA, (3) Explore Astroport to see how swapping works, (4) Consider converting some LUNA to ampLUNA to earn staking rewards, (5) Once comfortable, explore providing liquidity to earn additional yields. Take it slow - DeFi has real risks.",
      "warning": "Never invest more than you can afford to lose. DeFi smart contracts can have bugs. Start small."
    },
    "best_pool": {
      "question": "What's the best pool to deposit in?",
      "answer": "There's no single 'best' pool - it depends on your goals. High APR pools have more risk. Stable pairs have lower IL but lower yields. LSD pools (LUNA/ampLUNA) offer good yields with minimal IL. Use our scores as a starting point but research each pool before depositing.",
      "factors": ["Your risk tolerance", "Assets you already hold", "How long you'll stay deposited", "Your views on specific tokens"]
    },
    "voting": {
      "question": "How do I vote on TLA allocations?",
      "answer": "To vote: (1) Acquire ampLUNA or arbLUNA, (2) Lock them on Votion or similar platform, (3) Allocate your voting power to pools you want to support via Eris TLA interface, (4) Optionally chase bribes for extra rewards. Votes last until you change them.",
      "note": "You need locked tokens, not just holding them. Locking gives you voting power."
    },
    "rewards_timing": {
      "question": "When do I receive rewards?",
      "answer": "TLA rewards are calculated at epoch end (weekly, Monday UTC) and distributed shortly after. LP rewards accrue continuously but may take a few hours to appear after epoch transition. Bribe rewards follow their own schedules - check the specific platform.",
      "claim": "Rewards don't auto-compound. You need to claim them periodically through the TLA interface."
    },
    "impermanent_loss": {
      "question": "Will I lose money to impermanent loss?",
      "answer": "IL is a real risk, especially in volatile pools. LUNA/USDC can have significant IL if LUNA price moves sharply. LUNA/ampLUNA has minimal IL because they're correlated. Stable pools (USDC/USDT) have near-zero IL. High APR often compensates for IL, but not always.",
      "tip": "If you're worried about IL, start with pools where both tokens are related (LSD pairs) or stable pairs."
    },
    "score_accuracy": {
      "question": "How accurate are your scores?",
      "answer": "Our scores are objective calculations based on public data - they're accurate for what they measure. But scores can't capture everything: governance risk, smart contract risk, team reliability, future changes. Use scores as one tool among many, not as definitive truth.",
